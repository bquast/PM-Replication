## Abstract

## Introduction

The merits of reproducible research are widely acknowledged by scholars in out field [e.g., [@demesquita2003symposium]; [@king1995replication]; [@rich2013publishing]].
Although few political science journals have clear replication policies [@gherghina2013data] and replications are still not published as much as they should [@carsey2014making], there is a growing debate on how to make the discipline more open and reproducible.
In the context of this debate we discuss how graduate education in particular is an interesting place for replications.
The replication of a paper can guide students during the transition from training to themselves undertaking research.
At the same time, graduate students are sufficiently knowledgable to undertake a replication relatively independently.
We identify three key area in which we argue that replication can help students (and teachers): 

1) familiarise students with cutting-edge research tools
2) experience the practical difficulties of research work (statistical work)
3) help produce a publishable paper.

In the sections below we will develop these ideas in some more detail.


## Familiarise with research tools

One of the key benefits of replications is that is introduces students to current research and its practice.
In many fields, the methodology is rapidly evolving often as a result of more data and data analysis tools.

Computation environments such the R framework [@R] or MatLab [-@MatLab] have greatly facilitated the development and implementation of new methods in both qualitative and quantitative research.
Personally designed methods can be packaged and made publicly available.
This had lead to a large rise in the number of algorithms being available, often written by the authors of the methods themselves.
However, non-commericial methods through which these software packages are distributed, combined with the vast number of them,
can make it a somewhat daunting task determine the right software.

Replications generally concern published and peer-reviewed articles,
which means that the methods employed are proven to work
and have also undergone some review by the original author as well the reviewers.
This becomes especially useful when - as in most research - a combination of different methods is required.

For instance, when replicating the paper **Exploring temporal relationships between scientific and technical fronts: a case of biotechnology field** by Huang et al. [-@huang2014exploring], the following packages will be used:

* iGraph (social networks)
* tm (text mining)
* RWeka (machine learning)

and their interactions.

Combinations of tools like these are very fertile in their utility across disciplines and also methodologies.
In this instance, **tm** is used to mine text documents (research papers and patent applications),
after which **RWeka** is used to apply machine learning techniques to this information.
Finally, **iGraph** is used to map the social network of these interactions.




* computational simulations
* data availability + bring home, make data available


## Practical Difficulties of Research

A good example is the replication of on the paper **Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis** [@rauchhaus2009evaluating] done by Bell and Miller [-@bell2013questioning].
