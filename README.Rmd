## Abstract

## Introduction

The merits of reproducible research are widely acknowledged by scholars in out field [e.g., [@demesquita2003symposium]; [@king1995replication]; [@rich2013publishing]].
Although few political science journals have clear replication policies [@gherghina2013data] and replications are still not published as much as they should [@carsey2014making], there is a growing debate on how to make the discipline more open and reproducible.
In the context of this debate we discuss how graduate education in particular is an interesting place for replications.
The replication of a paper can guide students during the transition from training to themselves undertaking research.
At the same time, graduate students are sufficiently knowledgable to undertake a replication relatively independently.
We identify three key area in which we argue that replication can help students (and teachers): 

1) familiarise students with cutting-edge research tools
2) experience the practical difficulties of research work (statistical work)
3) help produce a publishable paper.

In the sections below we will develop these ideas in some more detail.


## Familiarise with research tools

One of the key benefits of replications is that is introduces students to current research and its practice.
In many fields, the methodology is rapidly evolving often as a result of more data and data analysis tools.

Computation environments such the R framework [@R] or MatLab [-@MatLab] have greatly facilitated the development and implementation of new methods in both qualitative and quantitative research.
Personally designed methods can be packaged and made publicly available.
This had lead to a large rise in the number of algorithms being available, often written by the authors of the methods themselves.
However, non-commericial methods through which these software packages are distributed, combined with the vast number of them,
can make it a somewhat daunting task determine the right software.

Replications generally concern published and peer-reviewed articles,
which means that the methods employed are proven to work
and have also undergone some review by the original author as well the reviewers.
This becomes especially useful when - as in most research - a combination of different methods is required.

Many research focused platforms have emerge over the past few years which can be very useful at the various stages of a research / replication project.

Public repository website such as GitHub - or self-hosted open-source equivalents such as GitLab or Gogs - offer a good place to host project remotely. There are several key advantages to this:

* a remote backup
* a well documented and timed claim to the research idea
* ability to work collaboratively on data analysis (e.g. .R files)

More recently, the rise of continuous integration tools such as Travil CI, have created the additional advantage that code can continuously be tested automatically. For a full discussion of continuous integration in reproducible research see Fitzjohn [-@fitzjohn2014reproducible].

During  the dat aanalysis phase, working with combinations of different package can require quite some technical expertise, especially when a combination of different packages is required.
Q&A sites such as stackoverflow - and more recently the ones based o the open-source equivalent askbot, such as sagemath - allow users to post questions which can be answered by experiences other users (who gain reputation).
In addition to solving the direct issue of user posting, experienced users often offer other insights about interpretation of results, 


* Robustness to specification
* 
* computational simulations
* data availability + bring home, make data available


## Practical Difficulties of Research

A good example is the replication of on the paper **Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis** [@rauchhaus2009evaluating] done by Bell and Miller [-@bell2013questioning] provides an interesting example of how ....data separation...problem stata....


## Publish a paper

A finalised research project is only a first step towards a publishable research paper.
Following the example of the original paper, can help with structure,
