Introduction
------------

The merits of reproducible research are widely acknowledged by scholars
in out field [e.g., (Mesquita et al. 2003); (King 1995); (Rich 2013)].
Although few political science journals have clear replication policies
(Gherghina and Katsanidou 2013) and replications are still not published
as much as they should (Carsey 2014), there is a growing debate on how
to make the discipline more open and reproducible. In the context of
this debate we discuss how graduate education in particular is an
interesting place for replications. The replication of a paper can guide
students during the transition from training to themselves undertaking
research. At the same time, graduate students are sufficiently
knowledgable to undertake a replication relatively independently. We
identify three key area in which we argue that replication can help
students (and teachers):

1.  familiarise students with cutting-edge research tools
2.  experience the practical difficulties of research work (statistical
    work)
3.  help produce a publishable paper.

In the sections below we will develop these ideas in more detail.

Familiarise with research tools
-------------------------------

One of the key benefits of replications is that is introduces students
to current research and its practice. In many fields, the methodology is
rapidly evolving often as a result of more data and data analysis tools.

Computation environments such the R framework (R Core Team 2014) or
MatLab (2014) have greatly facilitated the development and
implementation of new methods in both qualitative and quantitative
research. Personally designed methods can be packaged and made publicly
available. This had lead to a large rise in the number of algorithms
being available, often written by the authors themselves. However,
non-commericial methods through which these software packages are
distributed, combined with the vast number of them, can make it a
somewhat daunting task determine the right software.

Replications generally concern published and peer-reviewed articles,

-   textual analysis
-   computational simulations
-   data availability -\> bring home, make data available
