Introduction
------------

The merits of reproducible research are widely acknowledged by scholars
in out field [e.g., (Mesquita et al. 2003); (King 1995); (Rich 2013)].
Although few political science journals have clear replication policies
(Gherghina and Katsanidou 2013) and replications are still not published
as much as they should (Carsey 2014), there is a growing debate on how
to make the discipline more open and reproducible. In the context of
this debate we discuss how graduate education in particular is an
interesting place for replications. The replication of a paper can guide
students during the transition from training to themselves undertaking
research. At the same time, graduate students are sufficiently
knowledgable to undertake a replication relatively independantly. We
identify three key area in which we argue that replication can help
students (and teachers):

1.  familiase students with cutting-edge research tools
2.  experience the practical difficulties of research work (statistical
    work)
3.  help produce a publishable paper.

In the sections below we will develop these ideas in more detail.

Familiarity with research tools
